node-mcnet
==========

Node.JS bindings for [libmcnet](https://github.com/deoxxa/libmcnet), an event
based, zero-copy, portable Minecraft network protocol parser.

Overview
--------

To find out about what libmcnet does, check out [its page](https://github.com/deoxxa/libmcnet)
on github. This binding aims to expose the functionality of the underlying
library in a way that fits in with the status quo of existing Node.JS modules.

Right now nothing works though. Mainly because I have no idea what I'm doing
with node or V8 internals.
